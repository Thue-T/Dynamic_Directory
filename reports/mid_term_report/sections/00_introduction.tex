\section{Introduction}

The primary goal of this project is to create a "Discovery Agent" that can build a database of Danish industrial companies, with a focus on steel and pipe fabricators. The agent will automatically discover companies, extract their capabilities, and store the information in a structured format.

The agent will follow a cyclical process to discover and process information, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:workflow}.
