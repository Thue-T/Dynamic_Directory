\subsection{Recommendation: Node-RED}

While n8n is a powerful tool, it may be overkill for this specific use case. \textbf{Node-RED is the recommended choice} for its simplicity, extremely low resource usage, and ease of setup. It provides all the necessary features to build the Discovery Agent's orchestration layer with minimal overhead.
